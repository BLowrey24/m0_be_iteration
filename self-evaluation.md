# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I would say I feel pretty confident with the each method and I think it's one of the easier methods.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
I found it to be pretty fun I found that what I used to figure it out was right the only reason it took me a while to figure out what was wrong with it 
was that I had misspelled something.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to practice checking for minor details in my code when something isn't running correctly.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I think I just mainly have more questions about code in general and just want to do more to see what I can really do with it in the end.
